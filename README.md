### Motivation
In this project we are interested in visualizing random walkers and quantifying potentially interesting emergent behaviors using JavaScript! Random walking (also known as Brownian motion) is a commonly observed phenomenon in nature. Its occurrence spans from the dispersal of pollen in the air to literal pedestrians "randomly" walking in a city.

### Status
This project is currently under development. Stay tuned for additional features or feel free to add your own!

### Installation
```terminal
1) Chrome is recommended. 
2) Install http-server (npm install -g http-server)
3) Run http-server in terminal (http-server)
```
The attached demo shows how active particles activate inactive particles during Brownian motion. The interaction strength can be set by the user and the number of active particles is visualized in a scatter plot. This demonstration can serve as an analogue for disease spread amongst occupants of a room.
