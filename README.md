### Motivation
In this project we are interested in visualizing random walkers and quantify potential emergent behaviors using JavaScript! Random walking (also known as Brownian motion) is a common observed phenomenon in nature. They span from dispersal of pollen in the air to literal padestrians "randomly" walking in a city.
